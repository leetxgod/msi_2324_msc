### Information
Title: "Author name disambiguation in publications using graph neural networks"

Professors Miguel Silva (mepsilva@fc.up.pt) and Fernando Silva (fmsilva@fc.up.pt)

### Objective
Develop an author name disambiguation method to adequately matches an author name with a person's real name, implement it, and compare its matching accuracy with that of existing methods, including the one used in Authenticus.

### Work Plan
1. Revise the literature on author name disambiguation methods for the context we are setting;
2. Become familiar with concepts and algorithms relevant for this work, namely heterogeneous information networks, graph neural networks, and clustering methods;
3. Prepare a dataset of validated publications from Authenticus;
4. Decide on the publication attributes and similarity metrics to use;
4. Implement a clustering algorithm to associate publications authors and known researcher names;
5. Performance evaluation
6. Dissertation writing
