\chapter{Counting}\label{chap:counting}
In this chapter, we will explore the concept of counting in the context of formal languages and automata theory as well as explain an attempt that was made towards match counting using a partial derivative automaton construction and why it didn't work.

\section{Counting in Formal Languages}
In formal language theory, counting refers to the ability of a language or an automaton to enforce numeric constraints over the number of symbols or patterns within strings. Specifically, it deals with the ability to recognize whether certain elements occur a specified number of timesâ€”or in a specific numerical relationship to others.
