In this paper, we give regex a formal treatment. We make a distinction between regex and extended regex; while regex present regular languages, extended regex present a family of languages larger than regular languages. We prove a pumping lemma for the languages expressed by extended regex. We show that the languages represented by extended regex are incomparable with context-free languages and a proper subset of context-sensitive languages.",

	abstract = {We introduce a notion of partial derivative of a regular expression and apply it to finite automaton constructions. The notion is a generalization of the known notion of word derivative due to Brzozowski: partial derivatives are related to non-deterministic finite automata (NFA's) in the same natural way as derivatives are related to deterministic ones (DFA's). We give a constructive definition of partial derivatives and prove several facts, in particular: 1.(1) any derivative of a regular expression r can be represented by a finite set of partial derivatives of r;2.(2) the set of all partial derivatives of r is finite and its cardinality is less than or equal to one plus the number of occurrences of letters from A appearing in r;3.(3) any partial derivative of r is either a regular unit, or a subterm of r, or a concatenation of several such subterms. These theoretical results lead us to a new algorithm for turning regular expressions into relatively small NFA's and allow us to provide certain improvements to Brzozowski's algorithm for constructing DFA's. We also report on a prototype implementation of our NFA construction and present several examples.}

The compiler accepts a regular expression as source language and produces an IBM 7094 program as object language. The object program then accepts the text to be searched as input and produces a signal every time an embedded string in the text matches the given regular expression. Examples, problems, and solutions are also presented.},
