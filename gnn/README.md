## Graph Neural Networks
### Information
This folder contains some info and tests related to GNNs.

### References
- [This](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks) is a blog post about GNNs. (based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907))

- [This](https://petar-v.com/GAT/) blog explains one of the most relevant architectures.

- The course ["Machine Learning with Graphs"](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/index.html#content) by Stanford is also a good introduction to this theme. Watch classes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 11. (watch more if needed and/or interested)
