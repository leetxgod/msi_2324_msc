# Unofficial Template for DCC/FUP Thesis #

## What is this repository for? ##

This is a WIP for a template for Latex for thesis in the [CS Dept.](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/) of the [School of Sciences](http://www.fc.up.pt/) in [Univ. of Porto](http://www.up.pt/). This is a personal development with no official release (i.e. using this does not entail an official sanction of the format).

You should also check what is stated in [Estrutura e Layout de teses](https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/pt/conteudos_service.conteudos_cont?pct_id=352122&pv_cod=18uaJfx9Xm2K)

## How do I get set up? ##
