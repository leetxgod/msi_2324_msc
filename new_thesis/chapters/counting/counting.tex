\chapter{Counting}\label{chap:counting}
In this chapter, we will explore the concept of counting in the context of formal languages and automata theory.

\subsection{Counting in Formal Languages}
In formal language theory, counting refers to the ability of a language or an automaton to enforce numeric constraints over the number of symbols or patterns within strings. Specifically, it deals with the ability to recognize whether certain elements occur a specified number of timesâ€”or in a specific numerical relationship to others.
